<h1>My favourite Mangas of all time</h1>
<h2>Mangas I wish i can read for the first time again</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Tokyo Revengers</h3>
The onlhy unrealistic point of this manga is tnhe time leap' the actual focus of the story is the hope of a 27 year old
man to save his ex gf from middle school. <br>
Althought it seemed not that hard as he thought he should just prevent the "accident" of the car crash that caused her 
the death in the real timeline, he soon realises it's much more complicated than that for there were many factors that 
caused her intentional death in evrery timeline each time he tried; adding to that the secong realisationthat it's not just
his gf that needs saving. <br>
I like it so much because it's quite it has some realistic tropes. <br>
I'm too attached to this manga that i felt real grief during every character's death and traumas;  nd even tho i know i will
never get bored of it i still ca't risk to watch it again for that ec=xact reason. 

<h3>Jujustsu Kaisen</h3>
A shonen, dark fiction manga. Even though i read manhy fictions none of them gav me the satisfaction JJK been able able to 
give me. <br>
Althout it becomes really depressing at some point and especiallhy having to watch the mc suffer from shame and guilt after he 
end up taking a lot more lives than he thought he could ever save as he promissed.<br>
Eve,n ikf it was'nt him directly but the curse inside whome he swallowed it's finger, it still haunts him for the thought
thzt it's technically still him since it's his own body wich he can't control that the curse uses to do what he wishes for.<br>
Additional to that he had to go throught watching his beloved ones die right in front of him wich makes him feel even more useless 
and it all happens so quickly and succetionally that he doesn't even get the chance to pull himself together for the next fight.<br>
It's honestly just so entertaining and fun and sad at the sad at the same time whilst the arcs are literally insanely exciting.
<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
It's one of the most uneedy of an introduction for it's huge reputarion.<br>
Even thought it's quite too long i'm personaly not complaining because it's arcs are heart touching and entertaining at once;
you drop few tears then get enturrupted by a joke here and there,and somewhat feel targeted at the reading of some quote because you
related to it in a way or another at some point in your life.<br>
And evn thoyght i usually i'm more into the mangas where the mc turns into a villain ifelt diffrently for this one because i, next to
the characters have seen how much power he holds and how he's sure about xhat he wants and will bit on his pain to not let himself fade 
in within his disturbing struggles and hatread, and modt importantly to nor forget his number one goal and dream of becoming a Hokage,
wich he completly deserves for his strong determination and hard hork for it.
